description: |
  Trackball threshold input processor that filters out small movements below a configurable threshold.
  This helps prevent accidental auto mouse layer activation from minor trackball vibrations.

compatible: "zmk,input-processor-trackball-threshold"

properties:
  movement-threshold:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Minimum movement threshold for trackball input.
      Movement is calculated as abs(x) + abs(y).
      Values below this threshold will be discarded.

  track-remainders:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Whether to track remainder values for precise input processing.
      This is required by the ZMK input processor system.

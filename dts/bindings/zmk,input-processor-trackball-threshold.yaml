  Trackball threshold input processor that filters out small movements below a configurable threshold.
  This helps prevent accidental auto mouse layer activation from minor trackball vibrations.

    description: |
      Minimum movement threshold for trackball input.
      Movement is calculated as abs(x) + abs(y).
      Values below this threshold will be discarded.
